# ESM and K-mer Baseline Pipelines

This document describes the original ESM and K-mer baseline pipelines that live in the `ESM/` and `kmer/` directories. These pipelines predate the AlphaFold/graph pipeline that drives the rest of the repo and are kept here for reference and reproducibility.

This project focuses on predicting Gene Ontology (GO) labels from protein sequences using machine learning models.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a complete pipeline including:

- Data preprocessing and splitting (70/15/15)
- Feature engineering (K-mer and ESM embeddings)
- Model training (MLP)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- GO namespace-specific modeling (BPO / CCO / MFO)
- Evaluation using IA-weighted Fmax

## 🚀 How to Run (Step-by-Step)

---

## 🔵 K-mer Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Run:
`kmer/data_preprocessing_kmer_70.ipynb`

This step:
- Cleans protein sequences
- Converts GO labels into multi-label format
- Filters GO terms (frequency ≥ 20)
- Splits data into:
  - 70% training
  - 15% validation
  - 15% test
- Saves processed datasets

---

### 2️⃣ Baseline Model (All GO)

Run:
`kmer/MLP_kmer.ipynb`

This step:
- Uses K-mer features (local amino acid patterns)
- Trains an MLP model on all GO labels
- Provides initial baseline performance

---

### 3️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning

Run:
`kmer/kmer_tuning.ipynb`

This step:
- Tunes model parameters (hidden size, dropout, etc.)
- Selects the best model using validation set

---

### 4️⃣ GO Namespace-specific Training

Run:
`kmer/kmer_GOsplit_70.ipynb`

This step:
- Splits GO labels into:
  - BPO (Biological Process)
  - CCO (Cellular Component)
  - MFO (Molecular Function)
- Trains separate models for each namespace
- Uses:
  - Training set → model learning
  - Validation set → model selection
  - Test set → final evaluation

---

### 5️⃣ Error Analysis

Run:
`kmer/kmer_error_analysis.ipynb`

This step:
- Analyzes incorrect predictions
- Identifies model weaknesses
- Examines label imbalance and difficulty

---

## 🔵 ESM Pipeline

### 6️⃣ Generate ESM2 Embeddings

Run:
`ESM/ESM2_embedding.ipynb`

This step:
- Uses pretrained ESM2 model
- Converts protein sequences into fixed-length embeddings
- Captures global sequence context

---

### 7️⃣ Baseline Model (ESM Features)

Run:
`ESM/MLP_ESM.ipynb`

This step:
- Uses ESM embeddings as input features
- Trains an MLP model
- Provides baseline performance using deep representations

---

### 8️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning (ESM)

Run:
`ESM/ESM_tuning.ipynb`

This step:
- Tunes model parameters
- Selects best configuration using validation performance

---

### 9️⃣ GO Namespace-specific Training (ESM)

Run:
`ESM/ESM_GOsplit_70.ipynb`

This step:
- Splits GO labels into BPO / CCO / MFO
- Trains separate models for each namespace
- Evaluates final performance on test set

---

### 🔟 Error Analysis (ESM)

Run:
`ESM/ESM_error_analysis.ipynb`

This step:
- Analyzes prediction errors
- Compares performance with K-mer
- Shows advantages of deep embeddings

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metric: IA-weighted Fmax

- Fmax = best F1 score across all thresholds
- IA-weighted = each GO term weighted by information content
- Rare and specific GO terms have higher importance

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Large files (.npy, .npz, .pt) are not included
- Please regenerate data using preprocessing notebooks
- Training was performed on HPC (Savio)
